# MSP430G2553 + Proteus v8.9 [.pdsprj]
# Texas Instrument’s MSP430G2553 microcontroller Proteus Design Suite Simulation Project
 The Proteus design files .pdsprj contains the necessary schematic and code( be it in .C or .HEX or .ELF ) and just after keeping some folders and files in one place, these Project files can simply be opened by Proteus Design Suite 8.9 or later or earlier and the simulation can be run. 
 
 The example .C programs are borrowed from a NPTEL course <Introduction to Embedded System Design> (https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc20_ee98/course) and their Git repository (https://github.com/ticepd/EmbSysDesign_NPTEL_Course) . Also there is a kit on which these all programs are focused on (https://lunchbox.sincgrid.com/docs/build/html/index.html) and all credits goes to them for creating these all.  Also this is an unofficial repository only I am maintaining for the Proteus Simulation and .INO and .HEX , .ELF files. They have taught the whole course and programs in detail by using a kit (https://store.sincgrid.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=109&search=MSP430) 
 
 But I am making all the hardware in Proteus Design Suite 8.9 and making all necessary adaptations, modifications and translations to run the same way as it would have been by having a hardware in hand. 
 Lastly for running everything you must have a Windows PC, Proteus Design Suite 8.9 or any version from 8.7 to latest 8.10, Texas Instrument’s Code Composer Studio v9 or later, best would be v9.3 (compiler version: TI v18.12.4.LTS), Energia IDE 1.8.10E23. Basically for running and developing you would need everything except for the hardware, extra you would need is Proteus Design Suite v8.9. 
 
 I have made the schematics and configuration for Proteus Project Files and have made necessary changes to codes of Embedded C, so that it can run software UART and be compiled using Energia IDE, because hardware UART on Proteus for MSP430G2x53, MSP430G2x13 does not work. So I have made all to software UART.

There is a need for detailed instructions for where to keep files and locate them, so as to run Proteus Simulations. Currently I have no time for that, If you are in urgent need of instructions, mail me at subhu990@gmail.com.
